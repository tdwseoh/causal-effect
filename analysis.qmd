## **Analysis**
This data was conducted in 2012 by Enos, which the data consists of attitudes toward immigration with no exposure and exposure to Spanish-speakers of each individuals on train platforms. To use this data, we have to assume the validity, which may be flawed in ways such as that Spanish-speakers may not have the same impact as in 2012, compared to 2024.
